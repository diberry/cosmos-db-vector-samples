.SYNOPSIS
Pre-down hook for azd — removes data files copied to sample directories during provisioning.

.DESCRIPTION
This script runs BEFORE infrastructure teardown and cleans up data files that were automatically
copied to language samples by the post-provision hook. It mirrors the post-provision logic:

DEPLOYMENT SCENARIOS:
  1. CREATE-INDEX: Database-only deployment (no containers/indexes pre-created)
     - Scenario triggered by: $AZURE_COSMOSDB_CREATE_INDEX_DATABASENAME environment variable set
     - Affects: All nosql-create-index-* sample directories
     - Files removed: HotelsData_toCosmosDB_byRegion.json, HotelsData_toCosmosDB_Vector_byRegion.json

  2. VECTOR-SEARCH: Full-stack deployment (database + containers + indexes pre-created)
     - Scenario triggered by: $AZURE_COSMOSDB_CREATE_INDEX_DATABASENAME NOT set or empty
     - Affects: All nosql-vector-search-* sample directories
     - Files removed: HotelsData_toCosmosDB.JSON, HotelsData_toCosmosDB_Vector.json

AUTOMATION MECHANISM (Future-Proof):
  This script uses wildcard patterns to automatically discover ALL language sample directories:
  - nosql-create-index-* matches: nosql-create-index-typescript, nosql-create-index-python, nosql-create-index-go, etc.
  - nosql-vector-search-* matches: nosql-vector-search-typescript, nosql-vector-search-python, etc.
  
  Why wildcard discovery? New language samples (e.g., nosql-create-index-rust) are automatically
  discovered and cleaned up with ZERO code changes. The script adapts dynamically.

CLEANUP STRATEGY:
  - Preserves original data files in ./data/ directory (repo root)
  - Removes only the copies that were placed in individual sample directories
  - Uses -ErrorAction Continue to skip missing files gracefully (sample may have deleted them manually)
  - Reports which directories were cleaned and file counts for visibility

ENVIRONMENT:
  - Runs with access to all environment variables set at command line (e.g., $env:AZURE_COSMOSDB_CREATE_INDEX_DATABASENAME)
  - Working directory: repo root (infra/ directory is sibling)
  - Exit code: 0 (success) or 1 (critical failure)
